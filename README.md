Docker/Traefik Deploy Script
===

Bash script that deploys static websites with an nginx web server using Docker and Traefik

In order for this script to run, you will need to have docker and Traefik already configured and running on your system. For more information on setting those up, take a look at the following resources:

* [Server setup with traefik and docker-compose](https://blog.kilian.io/server-setup/)
* [How To Install and Use Docker on Ubuntu 16.04](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-16-04)

These are only 2 simple guides that I found and used. You might find that there are others that are better suited to your situation, so give it a quick search!

Note: The original iteration of the script was written by the genius [Rob Herley](https://github.com/robherley) himself, so thanks to him!
